# Automated Relaxation of Materials with DFTB+
This repository contains scripts written by A. Davies and T. Kelsey to automate the relaxation of structures using the package, DFTB+. The current form of these scripts is written to work on the UWyo ARCC HPC, MedicineBow. If the HPC environment changes, be sure to follows the changes in [If the HPC environment changes...](#if-the-hpc-environment-changes). Be sure to copy all files in [bin](https://github.com/ADavies2/Auto-DFTB-Relax/tree/main/bin) into your personal bin and make them executable.

The primary automation is done by the bash script, **auto-relax.sh**. The structure in question is iteratively relaxed over four sequences starting from a SCC (eV)/Force (eV/Ã…) tolerance of 1e-1. The second sequence uses a SCC/Force tolerance of 1e-2. The third sequence uses a SCC/Force tolerance of 1e-3. The final sequence uses a SCC tolerance of 1e-5 and a Force tolerance of 1e-4. After each sequence is complete, a directory will be made titled **{TOL}-Outputs**. For instance, the directory containing the 1e-1 tolerance results is called **1e-1-Outputs**. The results stored in each directory are:
- charges.bin
- {TOL}.gen
- detailed.out
- submit_{COF}-scc-{TOL}
- {COF}-scc-{TOL}.log

**auto-relax.sh** also automatically calculates desired properties of the final structure. These properties are, including their output filename:
- The atomic densities ({COF}.densities)
- The cohesive energy and enthalpy of formation (Energies.dat)
- Pore diameters, surface areas, and volumes ({COF}.res, {COF}.sa, and {COF}.vol)

For a finished calculation, the final directory (1e-4-Outputs) will contain:
- charges.bin
- 1e-4-Out.gen
- 1e-4-Out.xyz
- charges.dat 
- detailed.out
- detailed.xml 
- eigenvec.bin
- {COF}-scc-1e-4.log
- band.out 
- {COF}-Out-POSCAR
- {COF}.densities
- Energies.dat
- {COF}.res
- {COF}.sa
- {COF}.vol
- OUTPUT.zeo

This script can be executed by executing the following: <code>auto-relax.sh relax.in</code>. The format of **relax.in** is described in [Relax.in](#relaxin). **auto-relax.sh** automatically generates the following files based on the user input into **relax.in**:
1. dftb_in.hsd 
2. submit_{COF}-scc-{TOL}

This means that the only files the user must support are the initial structure file and **relax.in**. The other necessary files will be generated by either **auto-relax.sh** or by DFTB+ for sequential runs.
